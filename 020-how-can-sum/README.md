# How Can Sum

## Problem
Can the given list of positive integers generate a required sum? If yes then how many ways?

My brain is not working properly. For that reason, I have decided that we will solve two tasks in the how-can-sum problem.

### Task-1:

Here we want to count all the possible paths to get a target_sum using list of positive integers.

**For example:**  
list = [2, 3]  
target_sum = 7

Then number of possible paths: 3


### Task-2:

Here we want to print all the possible paths to get a target_sum using list of positive integers.

**For example:**  
list = [2, 3]  
target_sum = 7

Then the possible paths are:  
[2, 2, 3]  
[2, 3, 2]  
[3, 2, 2]
