# How Can String

## Problem  
How can we construct a target_string using concatenating elements of the array?

The brain is still in the same situation. For that reason, I have decided that we will solve two tasks in the how-can-string problem.

### Task-1:

Here we want to count all the possible paths to get a target_string using concatenating elements of the array.

**For example:**  
arr = ['rk', 'rak', 'ke', 'esh', 'rake']  
target_string = "rakesh" 

Then number of possible paths: 1


### Task-2:

Here we want to print all the possible paths to get a target_string using concatenating elements of the array.

**For example:**  
arr = ['rk', 'rak', 'ke', 'esh', 'rake']  
target_string = "rakesh" 

Then the possible paths are:  
[rak esh]
